# lists
A web server that handles interacting with Discord bot lists.

Eventually, I will update this README with more information on what this API does as well as how to contribute. For now, simply feel free to take a look.

I made a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMZSDgA2pE8) where I discussed this API!
